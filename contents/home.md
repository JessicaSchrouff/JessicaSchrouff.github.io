I am a Director of Responsible AI at GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) in London, UK. Previously, I was at Google DeepMind where I investigated responsible machine learning for healthcare. Before joining Alphabet in 2019, I was a Marie Curie post-doctoral fellow at University College London (UK) and Stanford University (USA), developing machine learning techniques for neuroscience discovery and clinical predictions. Throughout my career, my interests have lied not only in the technical advancement of machine learning methods, but also in critical aspects of their deployment such as their credibility, fairness, robustness or interpretability. I am also involved in DEI initiatives, such as [Women in Machine Learning (WiML)](https://www.wiml.org/) and founded the [Women in Neuroscience Repository](https://www.winrepo.org/).


### Education
- PhD, Electrical engineering, University of Liege, Belgium, 2009-2013.
- M.E., Biomedical engineering, University of Liege, Belgium, 2007-2009.
- B.E., Engineering, University of Liege, Belgium, 2004-2007.


### Outputs
My research has produced a variety of outputs, including scientific articles and book chapters ([Google Scholar profile](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=2YWm2nMAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao)), as well as software and code. In particular, I was a key contributor to the Pattern Recognition for Neuroimaging Toolbox [PRoNTo](http://www.mlnl.cs.ucl.ac.uk/pronto/).


### Research interests

### Other interests
I enjoy reading, dancing and gymnastics. I am very interested in (gender) bias in humans and machines. I recommend the following books to engage on these topics:
- [Equity for women in science, by Cassidy R. Sugimoto and Vincent Larivi√®re](https://www.hup.harvard.edu/books/9780674919297)
- [How to be an anti-racist, by Ibram X. Kendi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_to_Be_an_Antiracist)
- [White fragility, by Robin DiAngelo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Fragility)
- [Gender shades, by Joy Buolamwini and Timnit Gebru](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v81/buolamwini18a.html)
