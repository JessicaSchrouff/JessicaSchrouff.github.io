I am a Director of Responsible AI at GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) in London, UK. Previously, I was at Google DeepMind where I investigated responsible machine learning for healthcare. Before joining Alphabet in 2019, I was a Marie Curie post-doctoral fellow at University College London (UK) and Stanford University (USA), developing machine learning techniques for neuroscience discovery and clinical predictions. Throughout my career, my interests have lied not only in the technical advancement of machine learning methods, but also in critical aspects of their deployment such as their credibility, fairness, robustness or interpretability. I am also involved in DEI initiatives, such as [Women in Machine Learning (WiML)](https://www.wiml.org/) and founded the [Women in Neuroscience Repository](https://www.winrepo.org/).<p></p>
